# Pub-Sub-Assignment #
This is an assignment required in my Summer 2022 Northwestern Data Engineering course and performs the following function:
* ðŸ‘£ A python code will generate orders and messages
* ðŸ§  The message will push to the topic in Google Cloud Pub/Sub

In order to better experiment, I applied two different version of codes to satisfy the above requirements:
1. This code will complete the pub/sub through pubsub_v1 package. https://github.com/Helenbzbz/Northwestern-Data-Engineering-Class/blob/main/Assignment5/pushtopubsub.py
2. This code will complete the pub/sub through writing command: https://github.com/Helenbzbz/Northwestern-Data-Engineering-Class/blob/main/Pub-Sub%20Assignment/order_generator.py
